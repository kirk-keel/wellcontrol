"""Reverse circulation: down the annulus, back up the drill pipe.

The influx travels up the **inside of the string**, and that is the whole
attraction. It never passes the casing shoe, so the shoe sees clean mud and a
falling surface pressure the moment circulation starts. The string also holds a
fraction of the annulus volume, so the job is over in far fewer strokes.

The engine has to swap which gauge is the independent one to do it. Forward, the
choke is on the annulus and casing pressure is what the volume balance sets.
Reverse, the choke is on the drill pipe and the pump is on the annulus, so the
roles change hands -- while both gauges go on meaning what they say.
