"""Bullheading: pushing the influx back where it came from.

The formation works both ways. Underbalanced it gives up gas through the
productivity index; pushed hard enough it takes fluid back. Bullheading is the
deliberate use of the second, and it is the one method that does not bring the
influx to surface at all.

**The threshold is the interesting part.** A zone does not start accepting mud
the moment it is overbalanced -- filter cake, near-wellbore skin and relative
permeability all have to be pushed through first. Without that threshold a
normal kill, flown a few tens of psi above pore pressure, would quietly bleed
into the formation for its whole duration, and bullheading would need no
pressure worth speaking of.
