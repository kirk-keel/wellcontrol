"""Drill ahead, take a kick, detect it, shut in.

The sequence that makes this a simulator rather than a choke trainer. On a
shut-in start the kick is handed over already sized and identified with the
pressures on the gauges; here the student has to earn all of it.

**The check that matters is the last one.** Nothing tells the engine what SIDPP
ought to read. The student drills into a zone, takes an influx through the
productivity-index response, shuts the well in, and the pressure that appears on
the drill pipe gauge is whatever the volume balance produces. It has to equal
pore pressure minus the mud hydrostatic -- the kill sheet identity -- or the
forward model and the rest of the library disagree about the same well.
