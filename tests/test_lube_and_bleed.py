"""Lube and Bleed, and the flow path that makes it possible.

The method only exists once the gas is at surface: pump a measured slug of mud
in on top of it, let the mud fall through the gas to sit beneath it, then bleed
off the gas the mud displaced. Repeat until there is no gas left. Nothing
circulates and the influx never goes anywhere except out of the choke.

**It needs the pump at the other end of the well.** Every other method pumps
down the string, where mud comes round the bit and pushes the annulus up from
below. Lubricating puts mud into the annulus from the *top*, through the kill
line. Same pump, same barrels, opposite ends -- and the engine has to know
which, because the two do completely different things to the fluid column.
