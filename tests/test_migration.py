"""Gas migration, and the Volumetric method it makes possible.

Every other method in the simulator is driven by the pump. Volumetric is not:
the well is shut in, nothing is circulating, and the thing moving is the gas
itself. Without migration the simulator simply cannot represent it, and a
shut-in well would sit still forever -- which is exactly what it used to do.

**The number to hold on to.** Gas migrating in a closed well takes its pressure
with it: it cannot expand, so it arrives at a shallower depth still carrying the
pressure it had lower down, and everything beneath it gains that hydrostatic.
Surface pressure therefore climbs at the mud gradient times the speed the gas is
rising. The engine is not told this. It falls out of feeding the expansion the
gas *wants* into the same volume balance as every other flow.
