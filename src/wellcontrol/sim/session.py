"""A student's session: the engine, a clock, and the controls they can reach.

Stage 3 of the simulator. The engine advances by simulated seconds and knows
nothing about wall time; something has to decide *when* to step it. That is this
module, and it is deliberately kept free of any web framework so the time model
can be tested without the HTTP stack.

## Time advances on demand, not on a background thread

Each call to :meth:`Session.advance` looks at how much wall time has passed
since the last one, multiplies by the speed setting, and steps the engine that
far. No threads, no timers, nothing running when nobody is watching.

Two consequences worth stating:

* **The well only evolves while somebody is looking at it.** For a self-study
  trainer that is right -- a student who walks away has not lost the kick -- and
  it makes every test deterministic.
* **Catch-up is clamped.** Without the clamp, a student who leaves the tab for
  ten minutes at 60x comes back to ten hours of simulated well, all integrated
  in one request. :attr:`MAX_CATCHUP_S` caps how much simulated time a single
  advance can cover.

## Why the clock is injected

``clock`` defaults to :func:`time.monotonic` but tests pass their own, so the
whole time model is exercised without sleeping. Monotonic rather than wall
clock: the simulation must not jump when the machine's clock is adjusted.
