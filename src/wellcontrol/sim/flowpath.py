"""The circulating system as a graph of equipment joined by valves.

Lining the rig up is half of well control practice, and it is the half a
calculation cannot teach. Here the system is a directed graph: equipment are
nodes, valves are edges, and every timestep the engine asks two questions.

* Is there a path from the pump into the well? If not, the pump deadheads.
* Is there a path from the well out to the pits? If not, the system is closed
  and anything pumped in has nowhere to go.

**Wrong lineups are not scored as mistakes; they simply do not work.** A student
who leaves the choke line closed gets no returns and has to work out why, which
is exactly what happens on a rig. Nothing here tells them what they did wrong.

## The rule that matters most

With the BOP **open**, returns take the flowline and there is no pressure
control -- the well is open to atmosphere and the choke is irrelevant. With the
BOP **closed**, returns can only leave through the choke or kill line, and the
choke controls the well.

Students reliably try to circulate a kick with the annular still open. The model
lets them, and nothing happens to the casing pressure, which is the lesson.
