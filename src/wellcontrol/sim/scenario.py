"""Scenarios, and the faults an instructor can inject into them.

Stage 5. Until now a session was "the reference vertical well, shut in or
drilling". A scenario names an exercise: which well, where it starts, what the
student is expected to achieve, and what -- if anything -- is going to go wrong
part way through.

**Scenarios are data.** Everything here is a plain dataclass built from
primitives, and :meth:`Scenario.from_dict` takes the same shape as JSON, so an
instructor can add an exercise without touching Python. The built-in library in
:data:`SCENARIOS` is the same structure, written out longhand.

## Faults are triggers, not scripts

A fault does one thing to one piece of equipment at one moment: the pump fails,
the choke plugs, the accumulator leaks. What follows is whatever the well does
about it, through the same volume balance as everything else. Nothing here
knows what a kick is or how a kill should go, and a fault cannot make the well
behave in a way it could not have behaved on its own.

That distinction is worth keeping. A scripted "and now the pressure spikes"
teaches a student to recognise a scripted spike. A choke that plugs while they
are holding 400 psi on it teaches them what a plugged choke feels like.
