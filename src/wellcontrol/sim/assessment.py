"""Event log, recorded trace, and scoring.

Stage 2 of the simulator. The engine says what the well does; this says what
the student did about it, and whether it was any good.

## Scoring is on outcome and margin, never on procedure

A student who holds bottomhole pressure by a slightly unusual route has done
the job. One who follows the textbook order and still fractures the shoe has
not. So nothing here checks the *order* of actions, and nothing checks the
lineup: a wrong lineup is not marked incorrect, it simply does not work, and
the consequence -- no returns, a deadheaded pump, an uncontrolled well -- is
what shows up in the metrics. That is the same standard the rig applies.

## The shoe, not MAASP

MAASP is a surface proxy for "the shoe is about to break", needed on a real rig
because nobody can read a gauge at 7,000 ft. The simulator computes shoe
pressure directly from the fluid column, so the hard limit here is the actual
shoe pressure against the actual fracture pressure. Peak casing pressure
against MAASP is still reported, because it is what the student was watching,
but it is informational -- a student can exceed MAASP briefly with light mud in
the annulus without hurting the shoe, and the physical limit is the one that
matters.

## Two integrals the engine has to own

Time outside the bottomhole pressure band, and volume of extra influx, are time
integrals. Only the engine sees every timestep, so it accumulates them; sampling
them back off the trace would miss short excursions between samples. Everything
else here is computed from the recorded trace and the event log.
