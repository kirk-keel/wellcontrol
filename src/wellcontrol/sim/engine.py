"""The forward engine: what the well does, given what the student does.

Everywhere else in this package the question is "what pressure must be held to
keep bottomhole pressure constant?" Here it is the opposite: the student has set
a choke position and a pump speed, and the well responds -- correctly if they
got it right, and badly if they did not.

## The equation the whole thing turns on

Surface pressure is not commanded. It emerges from a volume balance::

    dP/dt = (Q_in + q_influx - Q_out - q_loss) / capacitance

where ``capacitance`` is how many barrels the closed system swallows per psi::

    capacitance = V_mud x c_mud + V_gas / P_gas_absolute

That second term is the one that teaches. Mud is nearly incompressible, so with
little gas in the hole the capacitance is tiny, the system is **stiff**, and a
small choke movement swings casing pressure hundreds of psi. As gas rises and
expands at falling pressure, ``V_gas / P`` grows by orders of magnitude, the
system goes **soft**, and the same choke movement does almost nothing --
until the gas is at surface and it goes violent again.

Nothing about that is scripted. A student who learns to anticipate it has
learned to work a choke.

## What emerges rather than being coded

* Choke too open  -> BHP falls below pore pressure -> another influx (step 6)
* Choke too shut  -> shoe over-pressured -> losses, then breakdown (step 7)
* Choke shut with the pump running -> pressure spike (small capacitance)
* Pump started against a closed valve -> deadhead (no injection path)
* BOP left open -> returns up the flowline, casing pressure stays at zero, and
  the choke does nothing at all

## Deliberate simplifications

Single gas bubble, ideal and isothermal. Annular friction scaled from the
measured slow circulating rate by the square of pump speed. No gas going into
solution in oil-based mud. These are the same simplifications the rest of the
library makes, and they are documented rather than hidden.

        ``WellState.gas_migration_rate_ft_per_hr`` is a *measured* rate, and
        zero there means "do not assume the gas is migrating" -- the right
        conservative default when planning, because a method that depends on
        migration should not be recommended on an assumption.

        A simulator cannot take that view. The well does what it does, and gas
        in a vertical hole rises whether or not anybody put a number on it. So
        a measured rate wins where there is one, and otherwise the gas migrates
        at a representative rate wherever the trajectory gives it an up to go
        in. In a lateral it stays where it is, which is the whole reason
        Volumetric is blocked on horizontal wells.

        **Gas migrating in a shut-in well takes its pressure with it.** It
        cannot expand -- the well is closed and mud is nearly incompressible --
        so a bubble that rises 1,000 ft arrives still carrying the pressure it
        had 1,000 ft lower. The mud now beneath it adds its own hydrostatic on
        top, and bottomhole pressure climbs. Left alone it will break the shoe;
        bleeding it off in controlled steps is the Volumetric method, and this
        is the physics that method exists to answer.

        Rather than special-case the pressure rise, this returns the volume the
        gas *would* take up at its new depth if it were free to expand, and the
        caller feeds that into the same volume balance as everything else. In a
        closed system the balance turns it into pressure, and the arithmetic
        comes out at the textbook answer::
