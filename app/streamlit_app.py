"""Well Control Kill Planner -- Streamlit front end.

Run with::

    streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py

or double-click ``Launch Kill Planner.bat``.

Two pages:

* **Kill Planner** (``views/planner.py``) -- pick a well configuration and a
  kill method, enter the well and kick data, and get the procedure with
  diagnostic plots. Each plan links to the chapter explaining its method.
* **Learn** (``views/learn.py``) -- the teaching content from ``content/``,
  rendered in the app.

The pages are separate scripts rather than functions so each can be run and
tested on its own. Shared helpers live in ``shared.py``.
